Spotify, a music streaming platform, measures every song's individual statistics. One of these statistics is valence: a number from 0 - 100 describing the positivity from a song.
A song with a higher valence would have greater tones of happiness and joy, while lower valence expresses negative feelings like sadness or anger.
